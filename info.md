a kernel module creates a /dev/ file that corresponds to the hardware it's handling and registers it with the kernel. the kernel then, if that /dev/ file is accessed by some other program, services the read or write requests through the read write implementations in the driver. the driver then communicates with the hardware through memory mapped IO. The device file needn't be in /dev/ but can be anywhere in the system.
