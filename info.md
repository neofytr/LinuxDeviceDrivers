A kernel module creates a device file that corresponds to the hardware it manages and registers it with the kernel. When the device file is accessed by a user-space program, the kernel handles the read and write operations through the respective implementations defined in the driver's file operations. These operations are tied to the device file by the module. The driver then communicates with the hardware using memory-mapped I/O. While the device file is typically located in /dev/, it can technically be created anywhere in the filesystem.
